  Do not buy this! I recently read that Amazon sells pirated books (because they don't check they take the money no matter what they sell) which means, not only are the prints not authorized which is a legal issue, but for the consumer experience, it's detrimental as well. This box set is printed on such coarse paper (paper feels like industrial pulp), the ink becomes blurred and hard to read. Worse yet, I gave them to my daughter (who is too young to know about print quality and thus never complained), and she had to squint through volumes of this crappy print that totally ruined her eyesight, before I realized what was going on. Amazon you need to do better than this!

  Beautiful covers and tough packaging. Bought these for my neices and nephews. I can read them but they are having trouble because the print on the pages. Several are blurry like this and book 1 (currently in my neices possession) has several pages with light spots down the middle and you can barely make out the words. They keep bringing the books to us for help. Haven't been into the other 4 books yet. I imagine they will be similar.

  I LOVE the book series. I have the original copies (second US editions). But most of the books are battered and worn out because I bought them back in 04. I wanted a new set (partly for collection purposes) so I did some digging. This new version looked pretty and the graphics looked interesting as well.I really really wanted to love this new set. I did. But I couldn??t get past the font. The inside of the book is really hard to read as the text isn??t the usual version (like in the second US editions).Also, I??m a bit of a grammar nut. I cannot stand when a book uses the single apostrophe ( ?? ) instead of double quotation marks ( ?? ) for when someone is speaking. It makes it terribly difficult to read the book and follow the story. Eventually you could get used to it, I suppose. But for $130 I don??t want to have to get a headache every time I try to read these beloved books.I??m really hoping the new box set I ordered in lieu of these is better formatted.

It??s the same price as what you would be paying for each book individually in UK so, you??re not technically getting a deal, but it??s totally worth it if you??re wanting to read the whole series!

  Just received my package - the book set was shrink wrapped, along with a layer of bubble wrap around it - thus, it arrived in great condition! Mint? No - but ultimately I purchased it to have the UK versions of the books, as I already own the US set of books. I'm so happy to have it as part of my collection. Upon initial viewing of the books - the covers are beautiful! Love the illustrations. Can't wait to dig in and read the series as it was originally written, seeing as I thoroughly enjoyed reading the US versions :)  The box they come in is in good condition, as I mentioned, it is not mint, but it's good (small dented corner - nothing terrible). The books are tight inside the box, but I found it relatively easy to get one out - thus freeing up the rest, and the books also went back in together, albeit returning it to the snug box slowly is probably advised to avoid damaging covers etc. Shipping itself was on time, it arrived as expected.

  This is a sure fire, jump-up-and-down, and wiggle-in-excitement Christmas gift for the niece. She??s been asking for this set since she was 3!

  I read these one by one as they were released and loved every minute spent devouring every word. I was an adult with grown children during that first read. Now, as an old lady, a really old lady!, I bought the series for my Kindle and have spent the past several weeks binge reading these amazing stories again. They??re better the second time around. I found so many things I had missed. The stories were much richer and very much more meaningful during this marathon immersion. And don??t let anyone dismiss them as ??just children??s stories??. There??s nothing wrong with a good children??s story but the Harry Potter books are so much more. Amazing tales told by a master craftsman at the top of her game. The level of imagination it took to breathe so much life into these magical characters and the events surrounding them just leaves me awestruck.

  Over the years I have let muggles borrow my copies of the harry potter series, and I felt it was finally time to get a new complete set...as my old copies had fallen apart. Unable to preform The Mending Charm Reparo, it was time to buy a new set. After reading mixed reviews, (mainly for the paperback version) I went ahead and purchased this hardback set. The Red Box is bold, sturdy and the gold detailing is so aesthetically pleasing. I actually use it as decor in my bedroom, all the books are stored so nicely inside. Some reviews mentioned that there were duplicates or books missing, and that was NOT the case for this set. I got every book. Be sure to check yours!Hardback Red Box Collection Pros:-Sturdy Red Box stores books-Red Box closes magnetically-Books Are Perfect quality-Page quality is great-Words perfectly written (no printing issues)-Great size Book (roughly 5"" x 8"")-Beautiful Detailing on Dust Jackets-Underneath Dust Jackets- Book title written on spine, bold overall color with golden starsCons:-No images (i didn't want images anyway but just in case someone was wondering)-No formal invitation to Hogwarts included (It's not suppose to have this, i've just been waiting for years and was hoping it was finally time to receive mine)-Unable to put books down to stop reading. No chance to be productive in anyway, as you will continue to read for hours, days even. (This isn't really the books fault)Overall: The Hardback set is PERFECTION.

  This is a great set if you can find it. I bought it twice over a long time: once for myself and it was a very large paperback book and once when it was a small paperback... the small paperback write up was exact, as was the cover photo... but no mention was made of the rather big change in size... which also means change in type size. You may want to make sure of what you're getting up front. In any case, HP books are getting quite hard to find, sets even harder, and it seems no immediate (paperback) reissue is upcoming.. I've tried to check to get holiday presents and all I can find are very expensive fancy hardcovers for high (nosebleed high) price or  covers only, no books, to protect sets you may own. But that's how it works when very popular books sell out but are not sure-sellers enough to start a new run. It would never be a mistake to take a chance on a Harry Potter set and the hard cardboard case, if used, will keep the paperbacks protected, when kept away from damp or too much heat and free of dust. It may interest one to know these books are becoming so hard to find that sales are being made just on offering various COVERS for the original hardbacks.

  After rereading the series, I am struck by how incredibly detailed was the world Rowling created. You can immerse yourself in another world almost as real as our own. Her characterizations are equally rich. The series deserves every accolade it has received. The timeless themes flow through a mythology that resonate with todays times as well as other crisis periods in history. Children can enjoy the first books if they are school age. As the series progresses, the action becomes darker and the themes of evil versus good become more adult. The first time I read it with my daughter, the delay in waiting for each book to come out allowed her to age into the later books. Parents should know that the younger children will have more difficulty with books 3-6. A parents support, explanations, and reassurance are necessary if the child is too young to read the books for themselves.

  What can I say about JK Rowling's runaway best-selling series that hasn't already been said? This captivating septology had me hooked from beginning to end. The story is familiar to many. A bespectacled orphan boy, Harry Potter, goes to a school for wizards to learn magic and faces off against the evil Lord Voldemort (or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named). Prior to his acceptance to Hogwarts, Harry has been an outcast all his life, forced to live in a broom cupboard by his cruel aunt and uncle and constantly tortured by his cousin, Dudley. His whole life changes when he receives his acceptance letter and learns that he is actually a wizard, and he also learns that he is famous in the wizarding community for the downfall of Voldemort.At his new school, he meets his best friends, Ron and Hermione. Over the course of the seven books, the three of them go on many adventures together, mature from children to young adults, and face off against Voldemort.The series is great for escapism, with its vivid imagery, rich world-building, and  thrilling plot twists. I loved reading about all the different creatures and how magic works in this world. The books will keep you turning page after page as Harry faces off against seemingly impossible odds. Someone may say that Harry relies too much on luck to get him out of scrapes, but keep in mind that although he inadvertently defeated Voldemort once, he is still a teenage boy. In a straight up magical battle against Voldemort, wand to wand, Harry simply doesn't have the experience to come out on top.Get this phenomenal series today and enjoy this spellbinding world of witches and wizards.

  I have an adult reading age. So watching the childrens movies I wasn't tempted to read the books. But in the end, having bought them, I can tell that there is a great deal that is in the books, that has been removed in the movies - various parts of the story make much more sense, where 2 related events are in the book, but the first event was removed from the movie and I went ""Huh?"" until I read the books (finished last night). it also showed how  director can change the character, by the way he shoots them.

  This was a gift to my 10 year old son who loves the entire Harry Potter series. There's really no point on reviewing the story since this is perhaps one of the most popular and household name movie series throughout the world/planet. This review is mostly for the manufacturing quality of the books themselves.The set comes in a hard box with excellent and accurate Harry Potter characters and theme. The printing is high quality with crisp colors. This paperback set does NOT look like cheap imitation that you typically find on the side streets of Asia. This is an excellent high-quality gift set that will last for a very long time and definitely cherished by all Harry Potter fans everywhere.

  The Harry Potter series is never disappointing. This is my third trip through the books and I??ve enjoyed them more each time. There are so many new things that I noticed with each reading. I would like to have had a few more details about the different kinds of magic like the difference between jinxes and hexes and so on. Overall the books are fun. Best when read as a youth because your imagination hasn??t been destroyed by reality yet.

  I started reading the Harry Potter books along with everyone else who was lucky enough to hear about them when they first hit the book stores in the UK.The first in the series was certainly enjoyable, even though it was most likely intended to be targeted for younger readers than I was.Having said that, I was immediately transported to the wizarding world which JK Rowling described so well and in such a way as to be entirely believable.The subsequent books in the series were definitely more targeted to a wider audience age wise, and included concepts that are more often encountered by adults than pre teens or even teenage readers.Though the final three books contained quite dark subject matter, Rowling delivers the concepts and story line with imagery that enables the reader to see the light that often follows the darkest of times, and allows readers to recover hope right along with her characters.I have reread all the books in the series more than once and for me, the desire to reread a book is the indication that the author has succeeded in delivering a truly excellent tale.If you have not read the Harry Potter books, I really suggest taking the time to do so.

  I??ve never been a huge fan of audio books. They tend to put me to sleep. But Harry Potter is a huge love in our family, and I wanted something to listen to in the car that wasn??t Gospel (I??m not Christian), country, or pop. With an hour commute every morning, and another at night, the series makes it easy to plug in on the drive.Jim Dale??s narration is fun and captivating. My 5yo begs to listen to them over and over again (I think we??ve listened through all 7 about 8 times!). Jim makes up different voices for each character, immersing you in the emotions of the story.Our family loves them so much, I bought a second set for my boyfriend, who drives long haul!

  Outside:  Attractive covers, more colorful, more exciting, more juvenile, less elegant than those of the Signature edition.  Artwork is clearly inspired directly from the books though with a few concessions to the movies.  The cover to book one is particularly interesting in that Ron and Hermione's faces aren't clearly seen and the way they are drawn they could easily be Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, though on the back of another volume you see the characters clearly, and they are based simply on the books (a tall and lanky Ron, for instance).  My only real criticism is that in a few of the pictures Harry looks more like a girl than a boy, in my opinion.The paper covers themselves have an interesting texture that I haven't encountered before, sort of velvety.  When I first touched them I thought my fingers were leaving unsightly fingerprints/smudges on the strange material, but this was actually just the moisture from my hands which quickly evaporated.  Like most boxed sets the books are pressed tightly together, hard to get them in and out when they are all in there, but not as bad as a Hobbit and Lord of the Rings boxed set I own.Inside:  Font is about the same size as the Signature addition, slightly larger than the Scholastic edition most Americans are familiar with.  Like the Scholastic edition the lines are spaced more widely apart, making for more comfortable reading but larger books than the Signature.  The font itself is an unusual one, but quite attractive and easy on the eyes with the exception of some of the punctuation.  Most punctuation marks are strangely diminutive in size and shape.  This works fine for colons and semicolons, but the quotation marks look severe, the tiny exclamation marks look odd, and the weird little question marks are almost unrecognizable.  The Signature edition by contrast uses a very standard font.There are no illustrations at the chapter headings other than some little stars, but the letters, signs, and such that Harry comes across are rendered like illustrations.  They aren't the same as the Scholastic ones but it's the same idea, better than the Signature edition that just provided them in italics, without even signatures reproduced on the letters.  An interesting new element is a map of the Hogwarts grounds and immediate surroundings at the front of each volume.  This is entirely unnecessary and could be interpreted as spoilers for people just starting the series, but I think it's pretty cool anyway, giving the books themselves a more classic fantasy feel.  On the other hand the back of each book is packed with lame ads for related products, webpages, etc.  You won't find that junk, and just a minimal amount of those ubiquitous ""praise"" lines for the books/author, in the Signature edition.Language:  The differences between the British and American versions go beyond spelling and punctuation conventions or even sweater vs. jumper sorts of dialect.  For example a fair amount of food/candy has been changed in the American version to make things more familiar for American kids.  And of course there is the infamous changing of the Philosopher's Stone (a real piece of folklore) to the ""Sorcerer's Stone.""For an adult reader all this Americanization and dumbing down in the Scholastic version is inane and distracting, and even more so considering the inconsistency of these changes across the series.  I for one would much rather read the book as the author herself wrote it, even if it means looking up a word now and then.  Granted, there are a few things that might seem a bit irritating to an American, like no periods after ""Mr"" and ""Mrs"" and a tendency to say things like ""Gryffindor are the best House"" instead of ""Gryffindor is the best house.""  Again, I'd rather see the author's own choices and culture even when it feels wrong to an American, but it's a personal choice.

  This version acts as one large book, rather than seven separate books.  So when you are reading it is not pages left in the book you are on, it is pages till the end of the deathly hollows.Also, it never shows the name of the book you are on, it shows as the collection

  I remember buying the first Harry Potter book at an airport when my plane was delayed. It had just been published and I was curious. I got hooked and was in line to pick each successive book up at the store as they were released. Fast forward to a couple of months ago, I thought it would be fun to re-read. I saw many providers offering the books, but they seemed (especially the price) quite shady. After researching a little, I got this one.This book is a great way to read straight through all the books in order. I ended up carrying my Kindle around even more than normal, reading every chance I could. From Privot Drive to the final dual outside Hogwarts...it's a great ride!

  I was really worried about how my books would turn out since there are so many reviews about printing issues, missing pages, etc. Thankfully, I did not have any of these issues. The box itself came with some dents and very little damage but I don??t really mind since it??s going to be on my bookshelf. Also, the outside of the books were a bit dusty so I had to clean them with a cloth. I went through every book three times and all the pages were there and the printing looked normal. Some say that the pages are cheaply made, but I think these books will last a long time as long as you??re not handling them roughly. I think everyone should get this edition since the pictures are beautiful (although I??ve heard that they can contain spoilers for those reading for the first time.) This will be my first time reading Harry Potter and im very excited for the journey!

  It??s Harry Potter, what more can be said?!These books are amazing, being from the US, I??ve always wanted to read the books how they were intended to be read, without any changes. I absolutely love these books and the Wizarding world itself.These books look great and are flawless. I had no issues with packaging or missing pages. Some of the reviews worried me, and I??m sure there are bad experiences, but I haven??t had any issues.I would highly recommend these books to anyone looking to get that authentic Harry Potter experience.

  The books themselves are my favorite! The Kindle Version, not so much. I wish all the books were broken down into separate books but they??re not. They are one big giant book so if you want to read book 5, you have to skip all the way through the other books, to get to it. Because of that it also messes up the location, page number, percent read of book and how much time is left.
